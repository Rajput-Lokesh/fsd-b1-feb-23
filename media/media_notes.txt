Rules for determining the rendered size of the image.

Case 1:
width and height both are specified:
example:
<img src="camera.jpeg" width="600" height="400" />

rendered size = 600 x 400


Case 2:
only height is specified
example: 
<img src="camera.jpeg" height="400" />

Here the width will be such that the image aspect
ratio is maintained

example, aspect ratio is 3:2 (width:height)
height as 400

rwidth/rheight = 3/2
rwidth/400 = 3/2
rwidth = 3/2 * (400)
rwidth = 600

rendered width = aspect_ratio x 400

Case 3:
only width is specified
example: 
<img src="camera.jpeg" width="600" />

Here the height will be such that the image aspect
ratio is maintained

example, aspect ratio is 3:2 (width:height)
width as 600

rwidth/rheight = 3/2
600/rheight = 3/2
rheight = 600 / (3/2) = 2/3 * 600
rheight = 400

rendered height = (1/aspect_ratio) x 600

Case 4:
nothing is specified

example:
<img src="camera.jpeg" />
